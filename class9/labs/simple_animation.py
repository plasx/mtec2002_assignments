In this exercise, we'll animate a circle so that it moves from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen...

1. We'll store the circle's coordinates and velocity in the variables x, y and velocity.  
2. Since our game loops continuously, if we redraw the circle at a different position after each iteration of the loop, it will look like it's moving.  
3. To do this, we'll draw the circle using the values of x and y as the coordinates.  
4. At each iteration, we'll also increment that position with the value that we have in the velocity variable.

To write this code:
1. Copy the boilerplate code from the template exercise - hello_pygame.py.
2. Create three variables above the for loop.  Name them x, y and velocity_y.  Set them to the following values: 
	x: window_dimensions[0] / 2
	y: 0
	velocity_y: 1
3. Draw a circle using the x and y values above
	a. The code for the circle should go after the line that fills the background color in the while loop.  
	b. Use the x and y values to set the coordinates of the circle.
	c. Use the docs if you need help with calling the function: http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.circle
4. Increment your y value by adding velocity_y.
